        "solution": "Grover's failure to meet his sales goals was a failure, but there was no fear of failure or desire to succeed, and thus no pen or pencil motivation. Also, his interest in the sales activity was not triggered by an external stimulus, so it does not fall into the eraser motivation either. In summary, this behavior does not fall into any of these three categories of motivation.",

        "knowledge": "Psychologist Tom has recently proposed some new concepts of motivation. Pen motivation is the motivation that arises when people go through a failure and are motivated by fear of the consequences of that failure. Pencil motivation is the motivation that arises when people are motivated by a desire to succeed after they have gone through a failure. Eraser motivation refers to other ruler motivations that do not fall outside of pen motivation and pencil motivation. Ruler motivation refers to the kind of motivation that arouses interest in the activity itself as a result of an external stimulus.",

KV-type compounds include two kinds of HCl and NaOH. Monomers are pure substances composed of the same element, e.g., Na, O2. Compounds are pure substances composed of two or more different elements, e.g., H2O. If one of the reactants is a KV-type compound and the other is a monomers containing at least two atoms, a chemical reaction must take place in which the monomers combine one of the atoms directly with the KV-type compound, e.g., HCl + O2 = HClO + O. If one of the reactants is a KV-type compound and the other is a normal compound, then five copies of the KV-type compound will be stripped of the H's in it, and three of the H's will be combined with the normal compound, and the other two H's will make up H2, e.g., 5HCl + FeCl3 = 5Cl + FeCl3H3 + H2. When the above conditions are met, the charge properties of the individual elements will be disregarded, and thus a reaction must occur between the reactants. In all other cases, there will be no reaction between the reactants (even though the reaction would occur under normal conditions). The products of the reaction of a compound go into an inert state and do not react with other substances.",
